 Algorithm for external sort

External sort is needed when the numbers you want to sort do not fit into memory. 
This repository provide codes for external sort in different programming languages.

Currently supported languages are :
C++ 

Python

I have explained detailed algorithm in this blog (https://minimalcodes.wordpress.com/2016/05/29/sorting-large-number-of-elements-external-sort-in-cpp/).

Please create a Pull request if you implement the same algorithm in unsupported languages.
